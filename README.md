# Personal Profile

This is the source code for my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)-based personal profile site.

## Development

Run the development server with:
```sh
$ hugo server
```

There are several types of content entries that can be created:

* Project description
    * `hugo new projects/my-new-project.md`
* Job description
    * `hugo new work/my-new-job.md`

Be sure to fill out all fields in the front matter!
