This is the code as I follow along with the excellent book [_Writing an Interpreter in Go_][book] by Thorsten Ball. The book introduces the reader to the Go programming language and builds an interpreter and REPL for a C-like programming language called **monkey**.

I admittedly haven't spent much time on this after the initial rush but would like to eventually finish it. It was helpful in giving me a basic command of Go and lexing/interpreting/parsing, which helped me later while writing [vim-tagquery](/projects/vim-tagquery).
