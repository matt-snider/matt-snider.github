This was a fun little TODO/productivity app to try out two technologies I was very curious about: [Elm][elm] and [PostgREST][postgrest]. It consists of a PostgreSQL-based RESTful API and a simple web interface. 

<!--more-->

[Elm][elm] is a (purely) functional languge for the frontend that resembles Haskell (although they are quite different at a more advanced level I hear), so it compiles down to Javascript, HTML and CSS. It was my first contact with frontend functional programming and gave me a big _Aha_ moment with regards to the advantages of _static typing_ as compared to Javascript. It has also sparked my curiousity to try [Purescript][purescript] but as of writing I haven't yet.

[PostgREST][postgrest] is a fantastic idea and piece of software (built with Haskell) that turns a PostgreSQL database into a RESTful API. I found this idea so revolutionary and mindblowing and has since let me to other similar ideas (e.g. [Postgraphile][postgraphile] for GraphQL).
