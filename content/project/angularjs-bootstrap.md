This is a now abandoned attempt at building a Bootstrap4-based component framework for AngularJS. 

At the time, the company where I worked used AngularJS and Bootstrap, but decided against several existing component frameworks for various reasons. I decided  it would be fun (and maybe even useful!) to build one myself. I wanted to make a more ergonomic framework like some of the more modern ones, e.g. by using transclusion slots more liberally instead of properties, by hiding most of the Bootstrap boilerplate/CSS.

It was indeed fun, but I never completed the effort.

The project demo page/docs are still available **[here][docs]**
