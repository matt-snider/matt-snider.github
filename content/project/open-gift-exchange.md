This is very much a WIP and I haven't had much time for it lately, but the idea is to build an open-source solution for doing gift exchanges (e.g. _Secret Santa_). This was motivated by using other "free" gift exchange web apps and seeing how much advertising & data harvesting was going on.

The other motivation was learning more about Haskell, [Servant][servant-gh].
