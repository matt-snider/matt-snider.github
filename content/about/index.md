I'm a software engineer with 6 years of professional experience. I mostly work on web applications (frontend & backend), but enjoy learning new things and am open to working in other domains.

Currently, I'm focused on learning: **Rust** and **Haskell**

I'm interested in trying: **Erlang/Elixir**, **Kubernetes**
