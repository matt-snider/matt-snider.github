I'm a software engineer with over 5 years of professional experience. I mostly work on web applications (frontend & backend), but enjoy learning new things and am open to working in other domains. 

I was born and raised in Toronto, but I've been living in Bremen, Germany for the last several years.

Currently, I most enjoy writing software using **Python**, **Haskell**, **Rust**, and **React**. I'm very interested in trying out **Erlang/Elixir** and **Purescript**.
