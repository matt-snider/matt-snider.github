I'm a software engineer with 6 years of professional experience. I mostly work on web applications (frontend & backend), but enjoy learning new things and am open to working in other domains. 

I was born and raised in Toronto, but I've been living in Bremen, Germany for the last several years.

I really like writing software, in particular:

* Favourite programming languages: **Python**, **Haskell**, **Rust**
* Favourite frontend frameworks: **React**
* Also interested in learning: **Erlang/Elixir**, **Purescript**

Take a look at some of the [projects](/projects) I've worked on.
