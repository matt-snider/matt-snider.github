I'm a software engineer with 6 years of professional experience. I mostly work on web applications (frontend & backend), but enjoy learning new things and am open to working in other domains. 

I was born and raised in Toronto, but I've been living in Bremen, Germany for the last several years.

Below you'll find some information about what technologies I've worked with. 

I'm also interested in learning: **Erlang/Elixir**, **Purescript**
