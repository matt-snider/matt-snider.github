Hi, my name is Matt. I'm a software engineer from Toronto currently living in Bremen, Germany.

I've been working since 2013. I mostly build web applications, but I really enjoy learning new technologies and concepts,
so I'm open to working in other areas.

I've worked professionally with `Python`, `Java`, `C#`, and `PHP` in the backend, and have worked with many of the major frameworks in the frontend (`Vue`, `React`, `Angular`).
When I have some free time, I enjoy programming and learning `Rust` & `Haskell`. I've recently been looking into `Elixir` as well. At some point I'd like to try out `Purescript`
or `Bucklescript/Reason`.
