      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a now abandoned attempt at building a Bootstrap4-based component framework for AngularJS.&lt;/p&gt;

Here what the chord diagrams look like:
  Other than those basic features I haven&amp;rsquo;t really worked on it much and don&amp;rsquo;t have plans to.
There is also a basic demo here.</description>
